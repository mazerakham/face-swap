Here's an example curl request for the OpenAI DALL-E 3 API to describe an image:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4-vision-preview",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
          {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "Describe this image in detail."
          },
          {
            "type": "image_url",
            "image_url": {
              "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 300
  }'
```

Sample response:

Its fur is primarily cream-colored, with a sleek and short coat. The cat appears to be in a relaxed pose, looking directly at the camera with an alert expression. The background seems to be a blurred interior setting, possibly a living room or study."

Key points for using this API in your image describing app:

1. Use the GPT-4 Vision model ("gpt-4-vision-preview") for image description tasks[1].
2. Include both a text prompt and the image URL in the request[1].
3. Set an appropriate `max_tokens` value to control response length[1].
4. Ensure your OpenAI API key has access to the GPT-4 Vision model[1].
5. Handle rate limits and potential API errors in your app[1].
6. Consider implementing caching to improve performance and reduce API calls[1].
7. The API supports various image formats (JPEG, PNG, WEBP, non-animated GIF)[1].
