The following is the app we're building.  It is not yet built. 

Step 0: User lands on the app.  For now, no login.  They
just start on the first step of the workflow which is:

Step 1: User uploads a photo of themselves.  They are instructed
to make it a headshot.  When this happens, the photo is sent to
the backend which saves the photo on S3 with a public URL.  
This will be referred to as the Base Image.  

Step 2: User is prompted a sequence of questions.  The user
is told to visualize themselves having accomplished their
most ambitious life goals and envision what that looks like.
The app asks them a sequence of questions (and saves the 
answers in browser context):

- What is the setting?
- What are you wearing?
- What is the emotion?

Step 3:  The prompt answers are sent to an
image generation API (implemented in the backend) with some prompts; 
an image is returned showing a visualization of the user in the 
setting described, ALONG with an augmented prompt*

Step 4: The user is asked to comment on the image generated. 
They can type in any feedback they have.  This is appended
to the augmented prompt as '\n\nUser Feedback: ...' and sent
back to the image generation API to generate the new image.
This can happen until the user is satisfied.  This is called
the Final Target Image.

Step 5: The Base Image is face-swapped into the Final Target Image
using my face swap API, also already implemented in the backend.
The user is presented with the Final Result.  The process is over.

*Augmented Prompts: every time an image is generated by the API,
it needs to be returned ALONG WITH an augmented prompt.  This is
crucial if the image needs to be edited later.  OpenAI's APIs do 
not support robust image editing, so the only thing we can do is
capture OpenAI/Dall-E's "augmented prompts" (where they make
adjustments to our prompt before generating the image) and use 
(and adjust) that augmented prompt when we want to make edits to
the image.  Front-end will be responsible for maintaining
a cache of images and their associated augmented prompts.
