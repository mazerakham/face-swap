The following is the app we're building.  It is not yet built. 

Step 0: User lands on the app.  For now, no login.  They
just start on the first step of the workflow which is:

Step 1: User uploads a photo of themselves.  They are instructed
to make it a headshot.  When this happens, the photo is sent to
the backend which saves the photo on S3 with a public URL.  
This will be referred to as the Base Image.  

Step 2: User is prompted a sequence of questions.  The user
is told to visualize themselves having accomplished their
most ambitious life goals and envision what that looks like.
The app asks them a sequence of questions (and saves the 
answers in browser context):

- What is the setting?
- What are you wearing?
- What is the emotion?

Step 3: The prompt answers are sent to an
image generation AI with some prompts; an image is returned
showing a visualization of the user in the setting described.

Step 4: The user is asked to comment and ask for corrections
on the image generated.  They can iterate on this until
they are satisfied. 

Step 5: The final image is sent along with the headshot from
Step 1 to the face-swap API, which swaps the user's face into
the scene.  This is presented to the user on a final success 
screen.
