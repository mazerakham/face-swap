The following is the app we're building.  It is not yet built. 

Step 0: User lands on the app.  For now, no login.  They
just start on the first step of the workflow which is:

Step 1: User uploads a photo of themselves.  They are instructed
to make it a headshot.  When this happens, the photo is sent to
the backend which saves the photo on S3 with a public URL.  
This will be referred to as the Base Image.  

Step 2: User is prompted a sequence of questions.  The user
is told to visualize themselves having accomplished their
most ambitious life goals and envision what that looks like.
The app asks them a sequence of questions (and saves the 
answers in browser context):

- What is the setting?
- What are you wearing?
- What is the emotion?

Step 3: The "base image" and prompt answers are sent to an
image generation AI with some prompts; an image is returned
showing a visualization of the user in the setting described.

- First, the likeness from Step 1 and prompt answers from 
Step 2 are sent to Dall-E to generate an image which we 
will call "Target Image Precursor"
- Then, the Base Image and Target Image Precursor are sent
to the Icon8 Face Swapper API to generate a "Target Image"

Step 4: The user is asked to comment on the image generated


Generate target image for user

Combine description from base image with the results from part (b) to generate a target image.  

Collect user feedback on target image. Generate a target image based on user feedback - if desired.  

Perform face swap using result of (1a) and (1d)


Project Estimate:


2 Hours  Fix Icon8 client to use their API to fetch landmarks.  

2 Hours  Integrate with OpenAI Dall-E API and get working API.  (I researched this already and OpenAI's API does support our use-case.)

 2 Hour  Modify app workflow to accept user photo "base image", then prompt for questions.  

 1 Hour  New stage in app in which target image is generated for the user and user is asked to give feedback on target image. 

1 Hour Final stage - integrate the user-generated target image with existing face swap app.  Perform face-swap and provide user with result.  

1 Hour Deployment
